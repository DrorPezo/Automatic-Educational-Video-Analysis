# Automatic-Educational-Video-Analysis
Project B - automatic white board and lecture slide detection in educational video.
The project contains the following features:

- Download video from youtube and viewing it, with option to control video speed (without time scaling).
- Analyze the video, and extract whiteboard, lecture slides and keywords from the video. After the anlysis, the video will be separated to its scene. The user will be able to search the topic in the video by the keyword, and jump to the desired shot without navigating the video naively.
